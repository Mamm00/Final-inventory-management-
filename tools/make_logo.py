#  make_logo.py — the single source of truth for the Al Azhar Tex brand mark.
#
#  Run:  python3 tools/make_logo.py        (then: python3 tools/check_logo.py)
#
#  Everything is driven by one table, SPEC, whose values are MEASURED off the
#  supplied artwork by tools/measure_logo.py, not drawn from memory:
#
#    - the artwork's ring is circle-fit to centre (748.4, 481.2) px with its
#      OUTER edge at radius 426.9 px, from 190 rays over the arc where the ring
#      is the only ink (residual median 2.0 px, and its x/y radii agree to
#      0.1%, so the mark really is circular and the bbox's odd 899x862 extent is
#      the wordmark letters sticking out, not a squashed scan);
#    - the artboard is pinned to that: the ring's outer edge = 56 units on the
#      120-unit board, i.e. 0.13119 artboard units per photo pixel;
#    - so 1 artboard unit == 7.623 photo pixels, and every number below is a
#      pixel measurement divided by 7.623.
#    - tools/register_check.py then rasterises the result back over the photo and
#      reports the overlap per band: ring 0.84, monogram 0.89, crescent 0.79,
#      stars 0.73, wordmark 0.49 — every one of them at zero offset, with the
#      scale sweep peaking at exactly 1.00. That check is what the three earlier
#      guesses, which all looked plausible and all registered poorly, did not.
#
#  What the artwork actually is (this differs from a first impression, which is
#  why the earlier redraw was wrong):
#
#    ring      one navy arc, 89deg -> 286deg (197deg), stroke 6.2 on r=52.9,
#              ends cut flat. It does NOT close: the right-hand sector belongs to
#              the stars and the wordmark, and nothing is drawn behind them.
#    stars     five red stars in that open sector, 295.9 -> 2.3deg, and each one
#              measured singly: they ride the ring's OUTER edge (centres r 53.3
#              to 56.1, so the band is half behind them), they shrink along the
#              arc (circumradius 7.5 down to 5.5) and they are NOT turned to
#              face outward — all five share one rotation, tip at 295deg.
#    wordmark  "AL AZHAR TEX" along the ring's own circle: each of the ten
#              letters on its own measured angle, from 83.5deg (the "A" at the
#              bottom, just inside the ring's lower tip) to 13.7deg (the "X" on
#              the right), baseline r=60 so the caps grow inward to ~53 and the
#              letters overlap where the ring would have been.
#    monogram  a heavy navy bowl (annulus: mid r 12.1, stroke 10.8, so its counter
#              stays a 12x15 white hole) whose lower wall continues right into a
#              crossbar that meets a square-cut stem; the red element is a crescent
#              BAND under the bowl (outer r 19.4, inner 9.0, 11..194deg about its own
#              centre (48.5, 65.5)) - never a filled disc, and its ends are cut
#              radially.
#
#    strapline "FINE FABRICS", 40.7 units wide with a 5.4 cap height - so it is
#              condensed relative to a normal grotesque, hence the negative
#              tracking - sitting flat between the crescent and the wordmark.
#              Its ends droop under a unit, which is not worth drawing.
#
#  Only four SVG primitives are emitted — <path> built from M/L, <circle>,
#  <rect>, <text> with rotate() — so the mark renders identically everywhere:
#  no textPath, no arc flags, no filters, no web fonts, no bitmaps.
#
#  Outputs (all consumed by the app build; nothing is hand-edited downstream):
#    app/logo.svg          standalone lockup, colours baked
#    /tmp/azt_sprite.svg   inline <symbol id="azt-mark"> for index.html
